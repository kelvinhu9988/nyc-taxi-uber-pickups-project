# NYC Taxi Uber Pickups Project

This project used [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) to analyze interesting relationships between NYC Taxi Pickups Data provided by [NYC Taxi & Limousine Comission](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) and Uber Pickups Data found in the project [uber-tlc-foil-response](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response). The project also brought about a couple of potential applications derived from the analytics.
